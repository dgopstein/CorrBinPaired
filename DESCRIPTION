Description: Tests, utilties, and case studies for analyzing significance in clustered binary matched-pair
  data. The central function clust.bin.pair uses one of several tests to calculate a Chi-square 
  statistic. Implemented are the tests Eliasziw, Obuchowski, Durkalski, and Yang with McNemar
  included for comparison. The utility functions nested.to.contingency and paired.to.contingency
  convert data between various useful formats. Thyroids and psychiatry are the canonical
  datasets from Obuchowski and Petryshen respectively.
