## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
     
* Updated CRAN URLs to be canonical
* Added years and DOIs to references of implemented methods
      
## Test environments
* OS X 10.11.5, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 16.04, R 3.4.3
* win-builder,  R 3.4.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Durkalski (7:62)
  Eliasziw (7:40)
  McNemar (7:87)
  Obuchowski (7:50, 10:17)
  Petryshen (10:32)

  These are names, all of which are correctly spelled.
