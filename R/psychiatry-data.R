#' Pyschiatrist and patient disagreement data
#'
#' Psychiatrists and their patients were surveyed in pairs regarding patient
#' concerns and treatment. Each psychiatrist was asked whether each quesition
#' item was relevant to their patient and each of their patients were asked the
#' same. The data can be evaluated to answer the question of whether there was
#' patient/doctor agreement in each item. The sample was 29 psychiatrists, each
#' with 1-8 patients, for a total of N = 135 matched pairs.
