#' Pyschiatrist and patient disagreement data
#'
#' Reported by Petryshen, described by Eliasziw as follows:
#' Disagreements between patients and psychiatrists on check-listed items
#' that relate to patient concerns and treatment (Petryshen, et. al). One
#' of these items was the perceived relevance to treatment of the patientâ€™s
#' inability to tolerate certain medications. A sample of 29 psychiatrists,
#' who each treated from one to eight patients, were asked to identify whether
#' in their opinion this item was relevant to each of their patients. In turn,
#' the 135 patients who received treatment from these psychiatrists were also
#' asked this question, as it applied to themselves. The aim of the study was
#' to investigate if patients and psychiatrists would equally likely identify
#' a given item as relevant. Since each patient matches with one of the
#' psychiatrists in the study, this suggested constructing N = 135 matched pairs
#' of responses ( Yli, Y,,), i = 1,2, . . . , 135, where YIi = 1 or 0 is the
#' patient response (identifies the item or not) and Y,i = 1 or 0 is the
#' psychiatrist response.
